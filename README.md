# Deflation Problem

## Stage 1: Roots finding
1) Implement Newton in Julia using FowardDiff
2) Implement simple deflation
3) Use shifted deflation

## Stage 2: Systems
1) Newton in 2D
2) Add (shifted) deflation

## Stage 3: Nonlinear ODEs
1) Idea: use finite difference of Poisson to turn into nonlinear systems
