# Deflation Problem

## Stage 1: Roots finding
1) Implement Newton in Julia using FowardDiff
2) Implement simple deflation
3) Use shifted deflation
4) Apply deflation formula

## Stage 2: Systems
1) Newton in 2D
2) Add (shifted) deflation and deflation formula

## Stage 3: Nonlinear ODEs
1) Idea: use finite difference of Poisson to turn into nonlinear systems
2) Apply defaltion to the Bratu equation and the Painlevé equation
3) Plot the bifurcation diagram of the Bratu equation
4) Plot the evolution of the condition number of the Jacobian in "naïve" and "standard" implementations of the deflation

## Stage 4: Nonlinear PDEs
1) use finite difference in 2D on Poisson's equation with lexicographic ordering
